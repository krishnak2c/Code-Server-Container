## code-server on a Container

- Deployed containers do not persist, and are often rebuilt
  - Containers can shut down when you are not using them, saving you money
  - All software and dependencies need to be defined in the `Dockerfile` or install script so they aren't destroyed on a rebuild. This is great if you want to have a new, clean environment every time you code
  - Most app platforms do not support running docker or virtual volume mounts in the container.
  - Storage may not be persistent. You may have to use [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to store your filesystem on a cloud service. Documented below:
